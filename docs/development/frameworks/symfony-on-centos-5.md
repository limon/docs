Symfony is a PHP web application framework, providing the classes and tools required to build and enhance both simple and complex applications. Featuring easy AJAX integration, an admin interface generator, and more, Symfony has become a very popular choice for web application development.

Before installing Symfony, it is assumed that you have followed our [getting started guide](/content/getting-started/). If you are new to Linux server administration, you may be interested in our [introduction to Linux concepts guide](/content/tools-reference/introduction-to-linux-concepts/), [beginner's guide](/content/beginners-guide/) and [administration basics guide](/content/using-linux/administration-basics).

# Basic System Configuration

First, update all of the base packages:

    yum update

Install `make`, as it will be required for installation of the other packages:

    yum install make

Since CentOS does not include the latest version of PHP 5.2 (which is required for the Symfony Framework), you'll need to add an external repository. Add the [webtatic](http://www.webtatic.com/) repository:

    rpm -ivh http://repo.webtatic.com/yum/centos/5/`uname -i`/webtatic-release-5-0.noarch.rpm

Edit the file `/etc/yum.repos.d/webtatic.repo`. Under `[webtatic]` add the following line:

{{< file-excerpt "/etc/yum.repos.d/webtatic.repo" ini >}}
short_open_tag = On

{{< /file-excerpt >}}


Replace it with this line:

{{< file-excerpt "/etc/php.ini" ini >}}
short_open_tag = Off

{{< /file-excerpt >}}


Set the web server to start on boot and start it:

    /sbin/chkconfig --levels 235 httpd on
    service httpd start

Download the Symfony system configuration check file and run it:

    wget http://sf-to.org/1.4/check.php
    php check_configuration.php

You should get "OK" for all the tests.

# Create Your First Symfony Project

Create a project folder under `/home`. We will use sfproject as our project name:

    mkdir /home/sfproject
    cd /home/sfproject

Create lib/vendor folder under the /home/sfproject:

    mkdir -p lib/vendor
    cd lib/vendor

Download the latest Symfony release:

    wget http://www.symfony-project.org/get/symfony-1.4.5.tgz

Extract it and rename it:

    tar zxpf symfony-1.4.5.tgz
    rm symfony-1.4.5.tgz
    mv symfony-1.4.5 symfony

Go to the project root and generate the project:

    cd /home/sfproject
    php lib/vendor/symfony/data/bin/symfony generate:project sfproject

Now, Symfony has created all necessary files/folders for the project. You can have a look at them.

There is now a symfony executable shortcut under `/home/sfproject`. From now on you can use the `./symfony` shortcut (when you are in the `/home/sfproject` directory) to execute Symfony commands.

Configure the database, entering your MySQL root password for "pass":

    ./symfony configure:database "mysql:host=localhost;dbname=dbname" root pass

Generate the frontend application:

    ./symfony generate:app frontend

Now, we need to configure the web server to serve our new project.

Edit `/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf` and add at the end:

{{< file-excerpt "/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf" apache >}}
NameVirtualHost *:80
<VirtualHost *:80>
  DocumentRoot "/home/sfproject/web"
  DirectoryIndex index.php
  <Directory "/home/sfproject/web">
    AllowOverride All
    Allow from All
  </Directory>

  Alias /sf /home/sfproject/lib/vendor/symfony/data/web/sf
  <Directory "/home/sfproject/lib/vendor/symfony/data/web/sf">
    AllowOverride All
    Allow from All
  </Directory>
</VirtualHost>

{{< /file-excerpt >}}


Restart the web server:

    service httpd restart

Using your browser, browse to your Linode's IP address. You should now see the Symfony Project Created page. From now on, you can easily follow the [official Symfony tutorial](http://www.symfony-project.org/jobeet/1_4/Doctrine/en/).
